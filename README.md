# ATM-simulator
Full project with CRUD operation
The "ATM Simulator" project is a Java-based application that leverages the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)
API, SwingX, and AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) for creating a graphical user interface. This project simulates the
functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) and provides users with a virtual banking experience.
Key features and components of the project include:
User Authentication: Users are required to log in with their account credentials, and the application connects to a
database using JDBC to validate their identity.
Account Management: Once logged in, users can perform various account management tasks, such as checking
their account balance, depositing funds, withdrawing cash, and transferring money between accounts.
Transaction History: The ATM Simulator maintains a transaction history for each account, allowing users to review
their recent transactions.
Security: The application includes security features to ensure safe and secure transactions
GUI Interface: The user interface is developed using SwingX and AWT, providing a user-friendly experience with
graphical elements and controls for interacting with the ATM.
Database Integration: JDBC is used to connect to a database that stores account information and transaction
records, ensuring data integrity and persistence.
Error Handling: The application includes error handling mechanisms to provide informative messages to users in
case of invalid input or other issues.
